    "text": "Agency as Empowerment: The Alumnae Perspective\n      \n      \n        \n          \n            Room to Read’s Girls’ Education and Gender Equality Program cares deeply about agency.\n          \n        \n        The program helps girls build the skills, connections, and confidence to stay in school\n        and make informed decisions about their futures.\n      \n      \n        This page looks at how alumnae experience and navigate\n        family disagreements around major life choices such as education, work, marriage,\n        mobility, finances, and body autonomy, and how often those disagreements are ultimately resolved in their favor (or not). These results draw from data collected between 2023 and 2025, across the 1-year and 5-year alumnae cohorts.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  Where Disagreements Arise\n  Most alumnae “sometimes” face family disagreements over major life choices. \n     India and Vietnam stand out with more frequent conflicts, while \n     Tanzania and Cambodia report fewer disputes.\n  Disagreements are rarely absent, but their frequency varies widely across contexts.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Family Disagreements Reflect Shifting Agency Over Time\n  Like the chart above, most alumnae report that family disagreements occur “sometimes” rather than constantly, \n  with India and Vietnam showing the highest proportion of alumnae in this category. \n  Laos stands out for more persistent conflicts, while Tanzania and Cambodia \n  show the least.\n  Across cohorts, frequent disagreements lessen slightly, suggesting growing confidence and trust between alumnae and their families.\n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n    \n      1-year cohort\n    \n    \n      5-year cohort\n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n  Disagreements Cluster Around Education, Work, and Marriage\n  The most common points of disagreement are work, study, and marriage which are areas directly tied to alumnae's future independence.\n     Disputes over dress, behavior, and where to live also highlight the tension between personal choice and family or cultural expectations.\n  Why it matters: These topics cut to the core of alumnae's agency. \n     They show that decisions about education and livelihood often spark the most resistance, but even everyday freedoms, like mobility or appearance, remain topics of negotiation.\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  How Disagreements Differ by Cohort\n  Both the 1-year and 5-year cohorts identify work, study, and marriage as the most frequent areas of family disagreement. \n     These topics remain at the top of the list, empasizing how education and livelihood decisions continue to challenge traditional expectations.\n  For the 5-year cohort, disagreements are slightly less common overall, suggesting that alumnae gain more autonomy.\n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n    \n      1-year cohort\n    \n    \n      5-year cohort\n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        How Often Disagreements End in Alumnae's Favor\n      \n       Now that we’ve seen where disagreements occur and which topics drive them, we can turn to the key question: how often are these disagreements resolved in alumnae’s favor?   The charts below show how disagreements are resolved across the top topics, comparing the 1-year and 5-year cohorts, alongside the most common disagreement topics by country and a full ranking of outcomes from most to least favorable. \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  Reaching a Resolution\n   The topics with the highest disagreement rates (work, study, marriage) are also the ones least likely to end in the alumnae’s favor.\n  In contrast, lower-frequency issues like reproductive healthcare, children, or voting are much more likely to resolve in the alumnae’s favor when they do arise.\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  How Key Disagreements Are Resolved by Cohort\n  \n    Below we can see that in the one-year cohort, marriage disagreements are most often resolved favorably, but this drops noticeably by the \n    five-year mark as partially favorable outcomes increase.\n    A similar shift appears for study: strong favorable outcomes in the first year soften into more partial agreements \n    in year five. Work shows the opposite trend: what begins as mostly partial agreement in the one-year cohort becomes \n    more fully favorable for alumnae in the five-year cohort.\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Most Common Disagreement Topics by Country\n  \n  \n    This chart shows the most frequent areas of disagreement for alumnae in each country, \n    along with how often those disagreements were favorably or partially favorably resolved. \n    Each country’s top topic reflects a unique social tension, ranging from behavior in Tanzania and Cambodia \n    to study in India and Nepal, dress in Laos, and marriage in Sri Lanka.\n  \n  \n    In several countries, especially Tanzania, Laos, and Bangladesh, a large majority of alumnae\n    report favorable resolutions, suggesting that these disputes often end in empowerment or compromise. \n    In contrast, Sri Lanka’s marriage disputes and Vietnam’s work-related disagreements \n    show more partial resolutions, indicating areas where autonomy remains more constrained.\n  \n  \n    Overall, the variation across countries highlights that agency operates differently depending on cultural context: \n    where behavioral norms dominate, resolutions tend to be more favorable; where decisions touch on \n    marriage or work, tensions are harder to resolve.\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        From Resolution to Agency in Action\n      \n      \n        We’ve identified the most common disagreement topics and how they tended to be resolved.\n        The natural next step is to ask: how does agency shape the choices alumnae make?\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  Agency and Post-Secondary Education\n  \n    Alumnae with disagreements that are not resolved and are less likely to persue post-secondary education.\n  \n\n  \n    In our data, only about 1 in 8 pursue post-secondary education with an unresolved dispute:\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n \n  Compared with roughly 2 in 5 when the dispute is resolved:\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    How Agency Relates to Marital Status\n  \n  \n    Among alumnae with resolved disputes, the share who are married is considerably smaller, \n    while the never married/other group is larger. \n    In contrast, unresolved disputes are more frequently observed among those who are married.\n    \n  Note: The “other” category includes alumnae who did not answer the question or whose marital status could not be determined.\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Post-Secondary Education and Marital Status\n  \n  \n    Never married/other alumnae are much more likely to have enrolled in a post-secondary education program, while those who are\n    married are far more concentrated in the no post-secondary education category. The size of the gap reflects how strongly marital status is associated with post-secondary participation in this dataset.\n     \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Each resolved conflict represents a measurable shift toward autonomy and opportunity.\n\n  \n    \n      Disagreements cluster around work, study, and marriage.\n    \n    \n      Favorable or partially favorable resolutions are common across several topics.\n    \n    \n      Resolved disputes correspond with higher post-secondary education and lower rates of early marriage.\n    \n  \n\n  Future analyses may reveal how agency shapes life choices beyond these early outcomes."

For the 5-year alumnae, the picture shifts: about half are married, two-in-five have children, and around one-in-four have continued to higher education.\nWhile marriage and motherhood become more common with time, educational aspirations persist."
